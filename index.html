      <div class = "box" id="smilebox">Save some face, you know you've only got one
Change your ways while you're young
Boy, one day you'll be a man
Oh girl, he'll help you understand
Smile like you mean it
Smile like you mean it

Looking back at sunsets on the East Side
We lost track of the time
Dreams aren't what they used to be
Some things sat by so carelessly

Smile like you mean it
Smile like you mean it</div>
<div id="tranqbox" class = "box">Time it tells living in my home town,
Wedding bells they begin easy
Live it down, baby don't talk that much,
Baby knows, but baby don't tease me.
In the park we could go walking,
Drown in the dark or we could go sailing
On the sea

Always here, always on time
Close call, was it love or was it just easy
Money talks when people need shoes and socks,
Steady boys, I'm thinking she needs me

I was just sipping on something sweet
I don't need political process</div>

<div id="dustbox" class = "box">A Dustland Fairytale beginning
With just another white trash county kiss in '61.
Long brown hair and foolish eyes.
He'd look just like you'd want him to
Some kind of slick chrome American prince.

A Blue Jean serenade
Moon River, what'd you do to me?
I don't believe you.</div>
